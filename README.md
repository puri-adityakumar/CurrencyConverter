# CurrencyConverter

The provided Node.js script is a simple currency converter. The script allows the user to enter the amount, the currency to convert from, and the currency to convert to. The program then converts the amount from the "from" currency to the "to" currency based on a predetermined set of currency exchange rates.

The script will run in a console environment, and the user can repeatedly convert currencies until they choose to exit the program. The currency exchange rates are predefined in an object named "currencies." The script also includes error handling to ensure that the user input is valid.
